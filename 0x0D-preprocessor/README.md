The goals for this project are to create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024; create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 4.14159265359; write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line; write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x; write a function-like macro SUM(x,y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
