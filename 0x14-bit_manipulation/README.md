The goal of this project is to work with bit manipulation.  In doing so we need to write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int; write a function that prints the binary representation of a number; write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index; write a function that sets teh value of a bit to 1 at a given index; write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index; write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
