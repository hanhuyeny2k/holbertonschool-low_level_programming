The goal if this project is to learn more about linked lists and in doing so we write a function that prints all the elements, returns the number of elements, adds a new node at the beginning, adds a new node at the end, frees a list, deletes a head node of a linked list and returns the head node's data (n), returns the nth node of the linked list, returns the sum of all the data (n) of a linked list, inserts a new node at a given position and deletes a node at the index of a linked list.
